1. Install java
2. Download .tgz from Apache Spark official site [last version is recommended]
3. Set environment variables: $SPARK_HOME and add the bin directory to .bashrc
4. In case you're going to use Python API:
	1. Check Python is installed (Python3 is recommended)
	2. To write Spark Apps in python: Install pyspark module (pip install pyspark)
* To open spark-shell through Python API:
	- Python3 -> Create a VirtualEnvironment -> activate it (source entorno_name/bin/activate) -> execute pyspark (points to SPARK_HOME/bin)
	- Python2.7 -> Execute directly pyspark (points to SPARK_HOME/bin)
